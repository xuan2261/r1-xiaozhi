fix: reduce LED log spam and add comprehensive bug analysis

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (from device logs):

Issue #1: App Crash - Old APK Running on Device (CRITICAL)
- Log shows crash at MainActivity.java:458 (copyActivationCode)
- Current code has copyActivationCode at line 592-613
- Line numbers DON'T MATCH = Old APK still running on device
- Old APK doesn't have permission handling fixes
- Solution: Rebuild and install new APK

Issue #2: LED Control Disabled - No Root Access (HIGH)
- Log shows 'No root access, LED control disabled'
- Log spam: 'Cannot set LED color without root' (23 times)
- Root cause: App doesn't have su permission
- LED control requires: root + write to /sys/class/leds/multi_leds0/led_color
- Impact: No visual feedback, but app still works

Issue #3: Wake Word Detection Inaccurate (HIGH)
- Current implementation: Energy-based (primitive)
- Only checks audio volume, NOT actual words
- False positives: Any loud noise triggers
- False negatives: Soft speech doesn't trigger
- TODO: Integrate Porcupine or Snowboy ML model

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

Fix #1: Reduce LED Log Spam
File: LEDControlService.java
- Added comprehensive warning in onCreate() (one-time)
- Removed repeated 'Cannot set LED color' warnings
- Silently skip LED calls if no root (graceful degradation)
- App continues to work without LED feedback

Fix #2: Comprehensive Bug Analysis Documentation
File: BUG_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md (300+ lines)
- Detailed analysis of all 3 issues from device logs
- Root cause identification with evidence
- Impact assessment for each issue
- Solutions implemented and TODO items
- Testing plan with expected results
- Known limitations and future improvements

DOCUMENTATION ADDED:
- BUG_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md - Complete bug analysis with solutions

FILES MODIFIED:
- LEDControlService.java - Enhanced LED status logging

IMPACT:
- LED log spam eliminated (23 warnings to 1 warning)
- Cleaner logcat output for debugging
- App continues to work without LED (graceful degradation)
- Clear documentation of root access requirement
- Old APK issue: Requires rebuild + reinstall (GitHub Actions)
- Wake word accuracy: Requires ML model integration (future)

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Rebuild APK with latest code (GitHub Actions)
2. Install new APK on R1 device
3. Verify no crash when clicking Copy button
4. Verify LED warning shown once (not spammed)
5. Test wake word detection (known low accuracy)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- LED control requires root access (user must grant su permission)
- Wake word detection is energy-based (low accuracy, false positives)
- Old APK on device needs replacement

NEXT STEPS:
1. Monitor GitHub Actions build
2. Download and install new APK
3. Test on R1 device
4. Plan Porcupine/Snowboy integration for wake word
5. Consider r1-helper IPC for LED control
